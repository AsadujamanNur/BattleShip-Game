TIPS FOR THE GAME

prints out "This is how the board of the game would look like"
prints out "horizontal coordinates are labelled from 1-10 and vertical coordinates are labelled as a-j"

1) Prints out the board with the boxes (10x10)-horizontal(1-10), vertical(a-j)

**Maybe we need to show some examples or demo on this part (Placing the ship)**

2) How to place the ship - i)The player can choose either to place it horizontal or vertical?
                             (The program prompts the player to enter either 'h' for horizontal and 'v' for vertical)
                          
                           ii)Which ship they want to place? The ones within 2/3/4/5 boxes?
                             (The program prompts the player to enter which ship)
                             (The user need to place  4 ships over 2 boxes, 3 ships over 3 boxes, 2 ships over 4 boxes, 1 ship over 5 boxes)
                         
                          iii)Asking the coordinates that they want to place their ship in (x y) style
                              (And its x y coordinates(both separated by a space) where x is the row number and y is the column number)  
                               
                               ?? Do we need to make the user to only prompts a single coordinate, and use if else thousand times??
